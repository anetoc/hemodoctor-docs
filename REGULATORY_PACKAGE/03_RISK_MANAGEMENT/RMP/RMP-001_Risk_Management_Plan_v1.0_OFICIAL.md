## 6. Risk Estimation and Analysis (ISO 14971 §5.5)

### 6.1 Risk Analysis Methodology: FMEA

**Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)** used for quantitative risk estimation.

**FMEA Parameters:**
- **Severity (S):** 1 (negligible) to 5 (catastrophic - death/serious injury)
- **Probability (P):** 1 (rare) to 5 (frequent)
- **Detectability (D):** 1 (always detected) to 5 (never detected)
- **Risk Priority Number (RPN):** S × P × D (range: 1-125)

**Severity Scale (per ISO 14971 Annex E):**

| Severity | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **5 - Catastrophic** | Death or serious injury | Missed severe anemia → patient death |
| **4 - Critical** | Permanent impairment or serious injury | Delayed leukemia diagnosis → reduced survival |
| **3 - Moderate** | Temporary injury requiring medical intervention | Unnecessary biopsy due to false positive |
| **2 - Minor** | Temporary injury, no medical intervention | Patient anxiety from false alert |
| **1 - Negligible** | No injury | Cosmetic UI bug |

**Probability Scale:**

| Probability | Description | Estimated Frequency |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **5 - Frequent** | Expected to occur often | >1 per 100 cases |
| **4 - Probable** | Will occur several times | 1 per 100 to 1,000 cases |
| **3 - Occasional** | Likely to occur sometime | 1 per 1,000 to 10,000 cases |
| **2 - Remote** | Unlikely but possible | 1 per 10,000 to 100,000 cases |
| **1 - Rare** | Very unlikely | <1 per 100,000 cases |

**Detectability Scale:**

| Detectability | Description | Detection Mechanism |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **1 - Very High** | Certain detection | Automated error detection + UI alert |
| **2 - High** | High probability of detection | Manual review step + audit log |
| **3 - Moderate** | Moderate probability of detection | Clinician review (but may be missed) |
| **4 - Low** | Low probability of detection | Relies on patient symptoms |
| **5 - Very Low** | Not detectable | No detection mechanism |

## 7. Risk Evaluation (ISO 14971 §6)

### 7.1 Risk Evaluation Criteria

**Risk Acceptability Matrix:**

| RPN Range | Risk Level | Acceptability | Action Required |
|-----------|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **81-125** | **Unacceptable** | ❌ NOT acceptable | MUST implement risk controls; cannot release |
| **41-80** | **High** | ⚠️ Conditional | Risk controls required; residual risk review by management |
| **21-40** | **Medium** | ✅ Acceptable with controls | Implement practical risk controls; document residual risk |
| **11-20** | **Low** | ✅ Acceptable | Minor controls; monitor in PMS |
| **1-10** | **Negligible** | ✅ Acceptable | No action; document in risk file |

**Overall Residual Risk Acceptance Criteria:**
- **No unacceptable risks** (RPN >80) remaining after controls
- **All high risks** (RPN 41-80) reduced to medium or below
- **Residual risk vs. benefit:** Benefits outweigh residual risks (documented in §9)
- **State of the art:** Risk controls aligned with current best practices
- **ALARP Principle:** Risks reduced to As Low As Reasonably Practicable

### 7.2 Initial Risk Levels (Pre-Control)

**Summary of Initial Risks:**

| Risk Level | Count | Risk IDs |
|------------|-------|----------|
| **Unacceptable (RPN >80)** | 0 | None |
| **High (41-80)** | 2 | RISK-HD-005 (Alert fatigue, 60), RISK-HD-008 (Automation bias, 48) |
| **Medium (21-40)** | 8 | RISK-HD-001 (30), RISK-HD-003 (36), RISK-HD-004 (27), RISK-HD-107 (24), RISK-HD-301 (24), RISK-HD-401 (36), RISK-HD-404 (24), RISK-HD-405 (27) |
| **Low (11-20)** | 9 | RISK-HD-002 (18), RISK-HD-006 (16), RISK-HD-007 (18), RISK-HD-103 (16), RISK-HD-106 (16), RISK-HD-201 (16), RISK-HD-202 (20), RISK-HD-205 (16), RISK-HD-206 (16) |
| **Negligible (1-10)** | 6 | RISK-HD-102 (12), RISK-HD-104 (8), RISK-HD-105 (6), RISK-HD-302 (8), RISK-HD-303 (12), RISK-HD-305 (8) |

**Critical Finding:** 2 HIGH risks require mandatory risk controls before release.

## 8. Risk Control (ISO 14971 §7)

### 8.1 Risk Control Option Analysis (§7.1)

**Risk Control Hierarchy (per ISO 14971):**

1. **Inherent Safety by Design** (most effective)
   - Eliminate hazard through design (e.g., conservative thresholds, fail-safe algorithms)

2. **Protective Measures in the Device**
   - Reduce risk through built-in safeguards (e.g., input validation, alert throttling, fallback modes)

3. **Information for Safety** (least effective)
   - Warnings, training, IFU (e.g., user training, IFU-001 warnings)

**Strategy:** Apply hierarchy in order; combine multiple layers for critical risks.

### 8.2 Risk Control Measures
