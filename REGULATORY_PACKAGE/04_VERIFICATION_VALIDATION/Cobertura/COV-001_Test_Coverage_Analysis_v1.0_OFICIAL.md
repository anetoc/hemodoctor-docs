## 6. COVERAGE GAPS

### 6.1 Code Coverage Gaps

**Gap #1: Class C Coverage (1.3% gap = 37 lines)**

**Uncovered Code Examples:**

```python
# clinical_rules.py lines 487-492 (UNCOVERED)
def legacy_anemia_classification(hb, age):
    """DEPRECATED: Legacy classification (pre-v1.0)"""
    if hb < 0:  # Defensive check (impossible in production)
        raise ValueError("Hb cannot be negative")
    # Legacy code path removed in v1.0
    return "LEGACY_NOT_USED"
```

**Justification:**
- Legacy code scheduled for removal in v2.0
- Not reachable in production (defensive programming)
- Risk Level: LOW (no clinical impact)

**Action:** Document as known limitation, remove in v2.0 ✅

**Gap #2: Class A Coverage (2.5% gap = 52 lines)**

**Uncovered Code Examples:**

```javascript
// admin_dashboard.jsx lines 123-135 (UNCOVERED)
function renderLegacyReport() {
  // Admin-only feature (non-medical)
  // Used <0.1% of the time
  return <div>Legacy Report (deprecated)</div>;
}
```

**Justification:**
- Non-medical admin feature (Class A)
- Used <0.1% of the time
- No clinical impact

**Action:** Acceptable for v1.0, improve coverage in v1.1 ✅

### 6.2 Requirements Coverage Gaps

**Count:** 0 ✅

**All 35 requirements have complete test coverage.**

### 6.3 Risk Coverage Gaps

**Gap #1: RISK-HD-207 (MEDIUM) - Partially Tested**

**Risk:** External terminology server downtime (SNOMED CT)

**Current Verification:**
- Manual testing: ✅ Fallback to embedded DB verified
- Automated testing: ❌ Not implemented

**Justification:**
- Fallback mechanism implemented and functional
- Manual verification sufficient for v1.0
- Low likelihood (SNOMED CT uptime >99.9%)

**Action:** Add automated test in v1.1 (JIRA: HD-1236) ✅

**Gap #2: RISK-HD-305 (LOW) - Not Tested**

**Risk:** UI cosmetic issues (misaligned labels)

**Verification:** None

**Justification:**
- Cosmetic only (no clinical impact)
- Class A (low risk)
- Post-release user feedback will identify issues

**Action:** Acceptable for v1.0, no action required ✅
