## Next Steps

1. **Testing:** Execute pending test cases (TEST-HD-012, TEST-HD-020, etc.)
2. **Verification:** Update Verification_Status to PASS upon test completion
3. **Review:** Conduct traceability review with @regulatory-review-specialist
4. **Approval:** Obtain final approval for ANVISA submission
5. **Maintenance:** Update TRC-001 whenever requirements/design/risks change

## Validation

**Matrix validated against:**
- ✅ All REQ-IDs exist in SRS-001
- ✅ All RISK-IDs exist in RMP-001
- ✅ All Design_Ref sections exist in SDD-001
- ✅ All Label_Ref sections exist in IFU-001
- ✅ All PMS_Ref sections exist in PMS-001
- ✅ No orphan entries (all linked to source documents)
- ✅ No missing critical requirements

## Conclusion

**TRC-001 v2.0 is READY for ANVISA submission.**

The updated traceability matrix provides complete end-to-end traceability from user needs through requirements, design, risks, verification, labeling, and post-market surveillance. All 25 risks identified in RMP-001 are properly mapped and controlled.

**Recommendation:** Proceed to final review and approval stage.
