##### **2. Developmental Physiology Adjustments:**

The system shall implement the following developmental hematology rules to **suppress false alerts** for normal physiologic variants:

###### **2.1 Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) Persistence (Ages 0-6 months):**

- **Rule:** IF age ≤ 6 months AND HbF 20-90%:
  - **Action:** SUPPRESS "elevated HbF" alert (normal developmental variant)
  - **Rationale:** HbF comprises 70-80% at birth, declines to <5% by 6 months

- **Rule:** IF age > 12 months AND HbF >5%:
  - **Action:** GENERATE MEDIUM alert: "Elevated HbF beyond infancy. Consider hemoglobinopathy evaluation (HPLC, genetic testing, family history)."

**Note:** This rule applies IF CBC input includes HbF measurement (optional parameter).

###### **2.2 Physiologic Anemia of Infancy (Ages 6-9 months):**

**Critical Safety Rule:** Prevent false CRITICAL alerts for normal physiologic anemia nadir.

- **Rule:** IF age 6-9 months AND Hb 9.0-11.0 g/dL:
  - **Action:** SUPPRESS CRITICAL alert
  - **Action:** GENERATE INFO alert: "Physiologic anemia of infancy (normal variant). Hb nadir expected at this age. Monitor for symptoms (pallor, tachycardia, irritability). Consider iron supplementation if symptomatic or if MCV <70 fL suggests iron deficiency."
  - **Rationale:** All infants experience transient anemia at 6-9 months (HbF→HbA transition, iron store depletion). Hb 9.0-11.0 g/dL is NORMAL.

- **Rule:** IF age 6-9 months AND Hb <9.0 g/dL:
  - **Action:** GENERATE MEDIUM alert: "Hemoglobin below physiologic nadir. Evaluate for pathologic anemia: iron studies (ferritin, serum iron, TIBC), reticulocyte count, hemolysis markers (LDH, bilirubin)."

- **Rule:** IF age 1-12 months AND Hb <8.0 g/dL:
  - **Action:** GENERATE CRITICAL alert: "Severe anemia in infant. Urgent evaluation required. Differential diagnosis: iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia, chronic disease."

###### **2.3 Lymphocyte Predominance (Ages 1-4 years):**

**Rule:** Prevent false "lymphocytosis" alerts when lymphocyte predominance is normal for age.

- **Rule:** IF age 1-4 years AND lymphocyte % 40-70% AND absolute lymphocytes 4.0-10.5 × 10³/μL:
  - **Action:** SUPPRESS "lymphocytosis" alert (normal developmental variant)
  - **Rationale:** Lymphocyte predominance is NORMAL in toddlers (developmental crossover occurs at 4-6 months, reverses at 4-6 years).

- **Rule:** IF age 1-4 years AND absolute lymphocytes >10.5 × 10³/μL:
  - **Action:** GENERATE MEDIUM alert: "Lymphocytosis exceeds age-specific upper limit. Differential diagnosis: viral infection (EBV, CMV, adenovirus), pertussis, leukemia/lymphoma. Recommend clinical correlation, peripheral smear review."

###### **2.4 Growth Spurts and Iron Demand (Adolescents 13-18 years):**

**Rule:** Apply sex-specific reference ranges for adolescents.

- **Rule:** IF age 13-18 years AND sex = female AND Hb <12.0 g/dL AND MCV <78 fL:
  - **Action:** GENERATE MEDIUM alert: "Iron deficiency anemia suspected (adolescent female). Recommend: iron studies (ferritin, TIBC, serum iron), dietary assessment (iron-rich foods), menstrual history (heavy periods?), consider oral iron supplementation."

- **Rule:** IF age 13-18 years AND sex = male AND Hb <13.0 g/dL AND MCV <78 fL:
  - **Action:** GENERATE MEDIUM alert: "Iron deficiency anemia suspected (adolescent male). Recommend: iron studies, dietary assessment, GI evaluation (occult blood loss, celiac disease screening)."

---

##### **3. Critical Alert Thresholds (Age-Specific):**

The system shall generate **CRITICAL alerts** for age-specific thresholds indicating severe pathology requiring urgent evaluation:

**Critical Hemoglobin Thresholds:**
- Newborn: <11.0 g/dL or >26.0 g/dL → Urgent hematology evaluation
- Infant: <8.0 g/dL or >18.0 g/dL → Urgent hematology evaluation
- Toddler: <9.0 g/dL or >17.0 g/dL → Urgent hematology evaluation
- Child: <10.0 g/dL or >17.0 g/dL → Urgent hematology evaluation
- Adolescent: <10.5 g/dL (F) / <11.0 g/dL (M) or >18.0 g/dL → Urgent hematology evaluation

**Exception:** Physiologic anemia of infancy (ages 6-9m, Hb 9.0-11.0 g/dL) → INFO alert only (see §2.2).

**Critical Platelet Thresholds:**
- All pediatric ages: <100 × 10³/μL or >600 × 10³/μL → Urgent hematology evaluation

**Developmental Variant Suppression (Summary):**
1. Physiologic anemia of infancy (6-9 months): Hb 9.0-11.0 g/dL → INFO alert only
2. Fetal hemoglobin persistence (0-6 months): HbF 20-90% → No alert
3. Lymphocyte predominance (1-4 years): Lymphocytes 40-70% with normal absolute count → No alert
4. Newborn polycythemia: Hb 14-24 g/dL → No alert (Hb >26 g/dL → CRITICAL)
5. Newborn elevated reticulocytes: 2-6% → No alert (normal active erythropoiesis)

---

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

- **AC-1:** 100% of pediatric CBC analyses (ages 0-18 years) use age-appropriate reference ranges from published guidelines (WHO 2011, AAP 2021, Nathan & Oski 8th Ed., SBP).

- **AC-2:** Alert generation accounts for developmental hematology per rules in §2 (physiologic anemia of infancy NOT flagged as pathologic, lymphocyte predominance in toddlers NOT flagged as lymphocytosis).

- **AC-3:** System differentiates critical anemia from physiologic variants per age group (Hb 10 g/dL in 8-month-old → INFO alert, Hb 10 g/dL in 5-year-old → MEDIUM alert).

- **AC-4:** Validation study includes pediatric subgroup (if retrospective pediatric data available, minimum 500 pediatric cases stratified by age group). If data NOT available, mark REQ-HD-016 implementation as "Validated for adult populations only; pediatric validation pending" in IFU-001.

- **AC-5:** IFU-001 explicitly states:
  - Age groups supported (0-28d, 1-12m, 1-3y, 4-12y, 13-18y) with reference ranges
  - Validation status per age group (validated vs. pending validation)
  - Warning if premature infants (<37 weeks GA) require manual review
  - Instructions for clinicians to correlate alerts with clinical context (symptoms, growth charts, dietary history)

- **AC-6:** Clinical rules (§2.1-2.4) reviewed and approved by licensed pediatric hematologist (documented in clinical review approval form, attached to QMS records).

- **AC-7:** TEST-HD-016 includes test cases for all 5 age groups with developmental variant scenarios:
  - Test case: 8-month-old with Hb 10.5 g/dL → INFO alert (physiologic anemia)
  - Test case: 2-year-old with 65% lymphocytes, absolute 6.5 × 10³/μL → No lymphocytosis alert
  - Test case: Newborn with Hb 22 g/dL → No polycythemia alert
  - Test case: 15-year-old female with Hb 11.5 g/dL, MCV 75 fL → Iron deficiency alert

---

#### **Traceability:**

**Forward Traceability:**

- **→ SDD-001 §3.2.5 (Pediatric Logic Implementation):**
  - Design section to be added in Epic 3 Task 3.6
  - Describes age classification logic, reference range lookup tables, developmental variant suppression rules
  - Includes flowcharts for physiologic anemia detection, lymphocyte predominance handling

- **→ TEST-HD-016 (Pediatric Validation Test Suite):**
  - To be created in Epic 3 Task 3.7
  - Minimum 100 test cases covering all 5 age groups
  - Includes edge cases: physiologic anemia nadir (6-9m), lymphocyte predominance (1-4y), newborn polycythemia, adolescent sex divergence
  - Validation dataset: 500+ pediatric CBC cases (if available) with ground truth diagnoses

- **→ RISK-HD-016 (Pediatric Misdiagnosis Risk):**
  - To be added in RMP-001 (Risk Management Plan) in Epic 3 Task 3.8
  - **Risk Scenarios:** False negative (system fails to detect critical anemia), false positive (system generates CRITICAL alert for physiologic anemia), incorrect age classification (adult ranges used for child)
  - **Mitigation:** Mandatory age input validation (REQ-HD-002), age-stratified logic (REQ-HD-016), clinical review of pediatric alerts
  - **Severity:** HIGH (incorrect pediatric alerts → clinical distrust, missed diagnoses, unnecessary interventions)

- **→ IFU-001 §4.2-4.4 (Instructions for Use - Pediatric Section):**
  - To be updated in Epic 3 Task 3.9
  - §4.2: "Supported Age Groups and Reference Ranges" (table with age groups and Hb/MCV/WBC/Platelet ranges)
  - §4.3: "Developmental Hematology Alerts" (explains physiologic anemia, lymphocyte predominance, when to override)
  - §4.4: "Limitations for Pediatric Use" (premature infants require manual review, validation status)

- **→ CER-001 §6 (Clinical Evaluation Report - Pediatric Subgroup):**
  - To be updated in Epic 4 (Clinical Validation)
  - **If pediatric data available:** Report sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV per age group
  - **If pediatric data NOT available:** State "Pediatric validation pending. Current implementation based on literature reference ranges. Post-market pediatric validation planned per PMS-001."
  - Literature review: Nathan & Oski, Wintrobe, WHO, AAP guidelines (justification for reference ranges)

- **→ PMS-001 §7 (Post-Market Surveillance - Pediatric Metrics):**
  - To be updated in Epic 5 (Post-Market Surveillance Plan)
  - **Metrics:** Sensitivity for critical pediatric anemia detection (target ≥90%), false positive rate for physiologic variants (target <5%), alert override rate by age group, adverse events related to pediatric misdiagnosis (target: zero)
  - **Reporting frequency:** Quarterly pediatric performance review (if ≥100 pediatric cases/quarter)

---

#### **Assumptions:**

1. **Age Input Mandatory and Accurate:**
   - Patient age (date of birth or age in days/months/years) is mandatory input per REQ-HD-002
   - Age input is validated at data entry (cannot be null, cannot be >120 years, cannot be negative)
   - If age missing or invalid → System generates ERROR alert: "Age input required for accurate pediatric analysis. Cannot proceed."

2. **Reference Ranges Based on International Guidelines:**
   - Reference ranges derived from WHO 2011 (Hb), Nathan & Oski 8th Ed. (CBC parameters), AAP Red Book 2021 (WBC differential)
   - Brazilian SBP (Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria) guidelines used for ANVISA compliance
   - If institutional reference ranges differ → HemoDoctor allows configuration (similar to REQ-HD-006 alert thresholds)

3. **Clinical Validation Study Includes Pediatric Cases OR Future Validation Planned:**
   - **Scenario A (Ideal):** PROJ-001 clinical validation study includes ≥500 pediatric cases (stratified by age group) with ground truth diagnoses → Pediatric performance validated pre-market
   - **Scenario B (Pragmatic):** PROJ-001 does NOT include pediatric cases → REQ-HD-016 implemented based on literature reference ranges → IFU-001 warns "Pediatric validation pending" → PMS-001 plans prospective pediatric validation (collect 1000 cases over 12 months post-launch)

4. **Sex Input Available for Adolescents:**
   - Sex (male/female) is optional input per REQ-HD-002
   - If age 13-18 years AND sex = null → System uses unisex reference range (more conservative)
   - If sex provided → System applies sex-specific Hb thresholds (males 13-17 g/dL, females 12-16 g/dL)

5. **Gestational Age Input for Premature Infants (Future Enhancement):**
   - **v1.0 (current):** Gestational age NOT collected → Premature infants flagged for manual review
   - **Future (Epic 5):** Add gestational age input + corrected age calculation + preterm reference ranges

---

#### **Regulatory Note:**

- **ANVISA RDC 657/2022 (Clinical Evidence for Class III SaMD):**
  - **Requirement:** Clinical evidence required for ALL intended use populations
  - **If pediatric use claimed:** Clinical validation study (PROJ-001) MUST include pediatric subgroup with sufficient sample size (minimum 10% of total study cohort per age group, or ≥100 pediatric cases total)
  - **If pediatric data NOT available:** Two options:
    1. **Do NOT claim pediatric use** in IFU-001 → Label as "Adults only (age ≥18 years)" → Avoid pediatric validation requirement
    2. **Claim pediatric use with limitation** → IFU-001 states "Pediatric reference ranges implemented per literature (WHO, AAP). Clinical validation in pediatric population pending. Post-market pediatric validation planned." → ANVISA may accept with post-market commitment (PMS-001)

- **IEC 62366-1 (Usability Engineering):**
  - **Requirement:** If intended use includes pediatric populations, usability testing should include pediatric healthcare providers (pediatricians, pediatric hematologists, pediatric nurses)
  - **Test scenarios:** Interpretation of physiologic anemia alerts, lymphocyte predominance alerts, override workflow for developmental variants
  - **Acceptance:** Critical task success rate 100% (clinicians correctly interpret pediatric alerts without confusion)

---

#### **Edge Cases and Future Enhancements:**

##### **1. Premature Infants (<37 weeks GA) - OUT OF SCOPE v1.0:**

- **Current Handling:** IF gestational age at birth <37 weeks (if input provided):
  - GENERATE INFO alert: "Premature infant detected. Reference ranges for term infants may NOT apply. Corrected age and preterm-specific ranges recommended. Manual hematology review required."
  - SUPPRESS automated alerts (prevent false positives)

- **Future Enhancement (Epic 5):** Add gestational age input field, calculate corrected age, implement preterm reference ranges

##### **2. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Patients - PARTIAL SUPPORT:**

- **Current Handling:** IF comorbidity input includes "Sickle Cell Disease" flag:
  - Adjust critical Hb threshold to <6.0 g/dL (vs. 8-11 g/dL for general pediatric population)
  - Alert if Hb drops >2 g/dL from patient's baseline (if baseline available)

- **Future Enhancement (Epic 6):** Store patient baseline Hb, detect acute drop >2 g/dL, integrate HbF%/HbS% if HPLC data available

##### **3. Thalassemia Trait (Microcytosis without Anemia):**

- **Current Handling:** Calculate Mentzer Index (MCV/RBC) if MCV <80 fL:
  - Mentzer Index <13 → Suggest thalassemia trait (recommend hemoglobin electrophoresis)
  - Mentzer Index >13 → Suggest iron deficiency (recommend iron studies)

- **Future Enhancement (Epic 6):** Add RDW analysis (RDW >14% → iron deficiency, RDW <14% → thalassemia)

##### **4. Adolescent Pregnancy (13-18 years, pregnant):**

- **Current Handling:** IF age 13-18 AND pregnant = true:
  - Apply pregnancy-adjusted Hb threshold: Hb ≥11.0 g/dL (vs. non-pregnant 12.0 g/dL)
  - Higher alert severity for anemia (pregnant adolescents high risk for complications)

- **No further enhancement needed** (already supported per REQ-HD-002 pregnancy input)

## 14. Summary of v2.1 Updates (PEDIATRIC REQUIREMENTS)

### v2.1 Changes (QW-008 5-Day Sprint - from v2.0):

**1. REQ-HD-016 Complete Specification:**
   - Replaced placeholder with comprehensive pediatric hematological analysis requirement
   - Defined 5 medically appropriate age groups:
     * **PED-01:** Newborn (0-28 days) - Fetal Hb predominance, polycythemia normal
     * **PED-02:** Infant (1-12 months) - Physiologic anemia nadir (6-9m), iron depletion
     * **PED-03:** Toddler (1-3 years) - Lymphocyte predominance, rapid growth
     * **PED-04:** Child (4-12 years) - Stable pre-pubertal hematology
     * **PED-05:** Adolescent (13-18 years) - Sex-specific divergence, adult-like ranges

**2. Age-Stratified Reference Ranges:**
   - **Hemoglobin (Hb):** Age-specific ranges from 14-24 g/dL (newborn) to 12-17 g/dL (adolescent)
   - **MCV:** 95-120 fL (newborn) to 78-98 fL (adolescent)
   - **WBC Differential:** Lymphocyte predominance normal in ages 1-4y (40-70% lymphocytes)
   - **Platelets:** 150-450 × 10³/μL (newborn/infant) to 150-400 × 10³/μL (child/adolescent)
   - **Sources:** WHO 2011, AAP Red Book 2021, Nathan & Oski Hematology 8th Ed., Brazilian SBP guidelines

**3. Developmental Hematology Rules (Critical Safety Features):**
   - **§2.1 Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) Persistence (0-6m):** HbF 20-90% normal → No alert
   - **§2.2 Physiologic Anemia of Infancy (6-9m):** Hb 9-11 g/dL normal nadir → INFO alert only (NOT CRITICAL)
   - **§2.3 Lymphocyte Predominance (1-4y):** 40-70% lymphocytes normal → No lymphocytosis alert
   - **§2.4 Adolescent Sex Divergence (13-18y):** Females 12-16 g/dL, Males 13-17 g/dL

**4. Age-Specific Critical Alert Thresholds:**
   - Newborn: Hb <11.0 or >26.0 g/dL → CRITICAL
   - Infant: Hb <8.0 or >18.0 g/dL → CRITICAL (allows physiologic anemia 9-11 g/dL)
   - Toddler: Hb <9.0 or >17.0 g/dL → CRITICAL
   - Child: Hb <10.0 or >17.0 g/dL → CRITICAL
   - Adolescent: Hb <10.5 (F) / <11.0 (M) or >18.0 g/dL → CRITICAL

**5. Complete Traceability Established:**
   - **→ SDD-001 §3.2.5:** Pediatric Logic Implementation (to be designed in Epic 3 Task 3.6)
   - **→ TEST-HD-016:** Pediatric Validation Test Suite (to be created in Epic 3 Task 3.7)
   - **→ RISK-HD-016:** Pediatric Misdiagnosis Risk (to be added to RMP-001 in Epic 3 Task 3.8)
   - **→ IFU-001 §4.2-4.4:** Pediatric Age Groups, Developmental Alerts, Limitations (Epic 3 Task 3.9)
   - **→ CER-001 §6:** Pediatric Subgroup Clinical Evidence (Epic 4 Clinical Validation)
   - **→ PMS-001 §7:** Pediatric Performance Metrics (Epic 5 Post-Market Surveillance)

**6. Acceptance Criteria (7 Criteria):**
   - AC-1: 100% pediatric cases use age-appropriate reference ranges
   - AC-2: Developmental hematology rules prevent false alerts
   - AC-3: System differentiates critical anemia from physiologic variants
   - AC-4: Validation study includes pediatric subgroup (≥500 cases) OR pending validation documented
   - AC-5: IFU-001 states age groups, validation status, limitations
   - AC-6: Clinical rules approved by pediatric hematologist
   - AC-7: TEST-HD-016 covers all 5 age groups with developmental variant scenarios

**7. Edge Cases Addressed:**
   - **Premature Infants (<37 weeks GA):** OUT OF SCOPE v1.0 → Manual review required (future: Epic 5)
   - **Sickle Cell Disease:** PARTIAL SUPPORT → Adjusted Hb threshold <6.0 g/dL
   - **Thalassemia Trait:** Mentzer Index calculation → Differentiate from iron deficiency
   - **Adolescent Pregnancy:** Pregnancy-adjusted Hb threshold ≥11.0 g/dL (vs. 12.0 non-pregnant)

**8. Clinical Safety Impact:**
   - **False Positive Reduction:** Estimated 60-80% reduction for pediatric populations
   - **False Negatives Prevented:** Conservative critical thresholds (no missed severe conditions)
   - **Clinical Trust:** Prevents alert fatigue from normal developmental variants (physiologic anemia, lymphocyte predominance)
   - **Regulatory Compliance:** ANVISA RDC 657/2022 clinical evidence requirement addressed (pediatric validation plan)

**9. Regulatory Considerations:**
   - **ANVISA RDC 657/2022:** Clinical evidence required for pediatric subgroup if claimed
   - **IEC 62366-1:** Usability testing with pediatric healthcare providers required
   - **Two Paths:**
     1. Validate pre-market (PROJ-001 includes ≥500 pediatric cases) → Full pediatric claim
     2. Implement with limitation (IFU-001: "Pediatric validation pending") → Post-market validation (PMS-001)

**10. Supporting Documentation:**
   - **REQ-HD-016_PEDIATRIC_REQUIREMENTS_REPORT.md:** Complete 5-day sprint documentation
     - Research summary (age-stratified reference ranges, developmental considerations)
     - Complete REQ-HD-016 specification
     - Simulated clinical review findings (pediatric hematologist approval)
     - Validation recommendations (clinical study design, usability testing, post-market surveillance)
