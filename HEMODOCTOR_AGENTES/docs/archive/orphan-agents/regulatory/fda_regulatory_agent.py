1.3.2 Differences and Assessment:
{self._format_differences_assessment(best_predicate)}

1.4 SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS COMPARISON

1.4.1 Safety Profile Comparison:
Both devices provide similar safety profiles with the following considerations:
- Risk of false negative results leading to missed diagnoses
- Risk of false positive results causing unnecessary interventions
- Risks associated with software failures or malfunctions
- Risks related to user error or misinterpretation

HemoDoctor SaMD incorporates enhanced safety features:
- Dual validation system (AI algorithms + clinical rules)
- Mandatory qualified user review for all critical findings
- Real-time system monitoring and automatic failover
- Comprehensive audit trail for all decisions

1.6 SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE CONCLUSION

Based on the comparison of intended use, technological characteristics, and
safety and effectiveness data, the HemoDoctor SaMD is substantially equivalent
to the predicate device {best_predicate.device_name} (K{best_predicate.k_number}).

The identified technological differences do not:
- Raise new questions of safety and effectiveness
- Require new clinical data beyond what has been provided
- Change the fundamental scientific technology of the device
- Affect the intended use or user population

The HemoDoctor SaMD demonstrates equivalent or superior performance compared
to the predicate device while maintaining an acceptable risk-benefit profile.

Therefore, the HemoDoctor SaMD is substantially equivalent and appropriate
for clearance under the 510(k) premarket notification pathway.
